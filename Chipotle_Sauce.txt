Ingredients:

    • 3/4 cup canola oil 
    • 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice 
    • 2 large heads of garlic 
    • 2 dried chipotle morita chiles 
    • 1/4 cup dried cilantro 
    • 1/4 teaspoon sea salt 
    • 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 
    • 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander 

Instructions:

    1. In a small bowl, cover the Dried Chipotles completely with hot water. Let them sit for about 15 minutes until they soften. 
    2. Preheat oven to 300 degrees. 
    3. Slice about 1/2 inch off the tops of the garlic cloves. You should cut across the tops of the cloves - leaving them partially exposed. 
    4. Wrap the garlic in foil drizzle with about 2 Tablespoons of the oil and place the foil packets in the oven until garlic is soft and slightly brown. About 30-45 minutes. 
    5. While the garlic cools, seed and chop the Chipotle Peppers. 
    6. Squeeze the garlic cloves out of the skin and add along with any oil from the foil packets and the remaining oil in the food processor or blender. Pulse a few times to break up garlic. 
    7. Add the chopped Chipotles, Dried Cilantro, Salt, Dried Cumin, Dried Coriander and puree until smooth. 
    8. If the sauce is a little thick you can add a Tablespoon of oil or lime juice to give it a sauce consistency. 
    9. Serve or store in the refrigerator for about 1 week - if it lasts that long. 
Makes 1 cup of sauce; 16 servings.

Hungarian Beef Stew
/from the Episode: Classic Beef Braises
<episode.asp?episodeid=278&iseason=10>/

Do not substitute hot, half-sharp, or smoked Spanish paprika for the
sweet paprika in the stew (see our recommended brands at right), as they
will compromise the flavor of the dish. Since paprika is vital to this
recipe, it is best to use a fresh container. We prefer chuck-eye roast,
but any boneless roast from the chuck will work. Cook the stew in a
Dutch oven with a tight-fitting lid. (Alternatively, to ensure a tight
seal, place a sheet of foil over the pot before adding the lid.) The
stew can be cooled, covered tightly, and refrigerated for up to 2 days;
wait to add the optional sour cream until after reheating. Before
reheating, skim the hardened fat from the surface and add enough water
to the stew to thin it slightly. Serve the stew over boiled potatoes or
egg noodles.

Serves 6
*1* 	(3 1/2- to 4-pound) boneless beef chuck-eye roast/ , trimmed of
excess fat and cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes (see note)/
** 	Salt/ /
*1/3* 	cup sweet paprika/  (see note)/
*1* 	(12-ounce) jar roasted red peppers/ , drained and rinsed (about 1
cup)/
*2* 	tablespoons tomato paste/ /
*3* 	teaspoons white vinegar/ /
*2* 	tablespoons vegetable oil/ /
*4* 	large onions/ , diced small (about 6 cups)/
*4* 	large carrots/ , peeled and cut into 1-inch-thick rounds (about 2
cups)/
*1* 	bay leaf/ /
*1* 	cup beef broth/ , warmed/
*1/4* 	cup sour cream/ (optional; see note)/
** 	Ground black pepper/ /



1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 325
degrees. Sprinkle meat evenly with 1 teaspoon salt and let stand 15
minutes. Process paprika, roasted peppers, tomato paste, and 2 teaspoons
vinegar in food processor until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes, scraping down
sides as needed.

2. Combine oil, onions, and 1 teaspoon salt in large Dutch oven; cover
and set over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions
soften but have not yet begun to brown, 8 to 10 minutes. (If onions
begin to brown, reduce heat to medium-low and stir in 1 tablespoon water.)

3. Stir in paprika mixture; cook, stirring occasionally, until onions
stick to bottom of pan, about 2 minutes. Add beef, carrots, and bay
leaf; stir until beef is well coated. Using rubber spatula, scrape down
sides of pot. Cover pot and transfer to oven. Cook until meat is almost
tender and surface of liquid is   inch below top of meat, 2 to 21/2
hours, stirring every 30 minutes. Remove pot from oven and add enough
beef broth so that surface of liquid is   inch from top of meat (beef
should not be fully submerged). Return covered pot to oven and continue
to cook until fork slips easily in and out of beef, about 30 minutes longer.

4. Skim fat off surface; stir in remaining teaspoon vinegar and sour
cream, if using. Remove bay leaf, adjust seasonings with salt and
pepper, and serve.




Step-by-Step: Skipping the Sear, but Not the Flavor

*RISING ABOVE IT ALL*
Even at a relatively low oven temperature, our method still triggers
browningâ€”but only on the "dry" part of the meat above the liquid.

Step-by-Step: Smooth Spice Solution

*COMMERCIAL CONVENIENCE*
Hard-to-find Hungarian paprika cream is a smooth blend of paprika and
red bell peppers. 	
*HOMEMADE SOLUTION*
We created our own quick version by pureeing dried paprika with roasted
red peppers and a little tomato paste and vinegar.

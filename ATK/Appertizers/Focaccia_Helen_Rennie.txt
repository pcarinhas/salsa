﻿Makes 2 medium loaves (roughly the size of a printer page, but oval)

Whisk together in a bowl of a stand mixer: 
316g water, 70-80F (21-27C) ---- tried 325 gr water for 72% water ratio to flour on 7/10/23 (l like it better)
1 tsp [3.2g] SAF instant yeast (or 1 and 1/4 tsp [4g] active dry yeast) 
8g honey

Add:
400g King Arthur unbleached all-purpose flour 
50g whole wheat flour (or more all-purpose) 
11g salt (that’s 4 tsp Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt or 2 tsp table salt)

Make the dough and let it rise: 
Mix with a hook until dough forms on low speed. 
Scrape down anything left on the walls. 
Knead for 3 min on low speed. 
If using a C hook, scrape down and rearrange the dough. 
If using a spiral hook, no need to rearrange dough. 
Knead for 4 min on medium speed (speed 4 on kitchen Aid) --It took me about 8 -9 minutes until the dough not sticking to the bottom
Place into an oiled bowl, cover the bowl with plastic and let rise until tripled, about 4 hours (assuming 70F/21C room temp). Our house temp is about
79 F so only took me about 2 1/2 hours.

Second rise:
Dump the dough onto a lightly floured work surface. 
Flatten to remove the bubbles. 
Give it 2 letter turns (see video), cut into 2 pieces*, shape each into a ball and place into 2 oiled bowls that are about a quart/liter in volume. 
Cover with plastic and refrigerate overnight or up to 5 days.

Shape, Proof, and Bake:
Fresh chopped up rosemary 
Extra Virgin Olive oil

For each focaccia: 
Put 1 Tbsp olive oil into a quarter sheet (13”x9”) or 11-12 inch skillet and spread it out. 
Dump one of the dough pieces onto a lightly floured surface. Put top side facing the table (on the bottom).
Flattened the dough (rectangle) and do 2 letter turns. Press it to remove the bubbles. Place on the oiled baking sheet. 
Cover with plastic, wait 1 hour. 
Stretch with oiled hands to the size of the pan (the dough should be about ½ inch thick). Cover with plastic. Let rise for 2 hours. 

When focaccia is about 1 inch thick, preheat the oven to 450F (230C) for 30 minutes. 
Sprinkle with rosemary (lots) and salt (tiny bit, skip if using table salt). 
Drizzle with 1 Tbsp olive oil. 
Poke holes with oiled fingers. Put a small dish of boiling water on the floor of the oven 5 min before baking. 
Put focaccia in the middle of the oven and immediately reduce to 425F and turn on the convection fan if you have it. 
Bake for 12-16 min or until golden brown (rotate several times for even browning, it took me about 20 minutes). 
Immediately drizzle with 1 Tbsp oil and move to a cooling rack. Let cool for 30 min.

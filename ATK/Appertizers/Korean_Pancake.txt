Korean Pancake

1 cup flour
1/2 cup corn starch/potato starch
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp bk powder
1 cup ice cold water (too reduce gluten to form)
1 cup sliced carrot strip thin
1 cup of sliced zuchini
7 green onions
1/2 c of sliced onion
2 c cabbage (I didn't use this)
1/2 c sweet potatoes

Mix all the vegetables in the flour mixture then add cold water to make like a paste not liquidy.
If you use 1/2 c flour, 1/4 c tapioka/corn/potato starch, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp bk powder 
then you need 2 1/2 cups of vegetables and 3/4 c cold water (maybe less).

1 cup of mix flour, use 3/4 c cold water.

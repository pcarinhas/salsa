Note on flour (Dec 2020 update): 
I have recently discovered that bread flour (I use King Arthur brand) works as well as "00" pasta flour that I recommended in this video https://amzn.to/2IE9VKB​. 
If neither is available, all-purpose flour works, but produces less chewy results.

Makes 4 portions (6 as first course) 

Pasta Dough:
300 g flour (King Arthur Bread Flour - result is good) 2 tsp Diamond Crystal Kosher salt (or 1 tsp table salt) (5.7g if weighing on a high precision scale) 
185g wet ingredients* (I am getting a lot of comments saying that it sounds like I am saying "285". it's "get to hundred eighty five", not "get two hundred eighty five".)

* Wet ingredients:
2 large eggs 
3 large yolks 
weigh the eggs and yolks then add enough water to get to 185 grams total

Buzz flour and salt in the food processor for 10 sec. Add the wet ingredients and process until dough forms. 
Knead by hand for 12 minutes. Flour the dough, wrap in plastic, and let rest 30 min to 5 (I let it rest for 2 1/2 hours) hours at room temp. 
Cut into 6 pieces, flattened it and roll it through the kitchen aid. I used till level 5.

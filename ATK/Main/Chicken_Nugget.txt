In a pot, combine all ingredients. Whisk to combine.

    1. Place into a bowl and toss together with salt, sugar, and MSG.
    2. Fill a heavy bottom pot with frying oil 2-3” high.
    3. For the breading process, start by making a thin batter by whisking together water and cornstarch. 
    4. Flour dredge consisting of all-purpose flour, kosher salt, MSG, white ground pepper, and celery powder. Whisk together. Pour into a 8x8 baking dish.
    5. Finally for the tempura batter/dredge, combine cornstarch, all-purpose flour, baking powder, and baking soda. Whisk to combine then add chilled water and the whisked eggs. Whisk all ingredients together until combined.
    6. Form the ground chicken into mcnugget like shapes. Drop into thin cornstarch mixture followed by tossing in the flour mixture, and then dip into the tempura batter. 
    7. Drop into the oil. Let batter covered fingers drop over the nuggets to create crispy flakes. Fry for 5-7 minutes. 
    8. Place on a wire rack to cool and repeat with the remaining pieces.

Ingredients 
    • 1/2 cup plus 1/2 teaspoon (123g) kosher salt, divided (see note)
    • 1/4 cup plus 2 teaspoons (58g) granulated sugar, divided
    • 2 large boneless skinless chicken breasts, split horizontally into 4 cutlets
    • 2 tablespoons  freshly ground black pepper
    • 2 teaspoons paprika
    • 1 teaspoon powdered MSG (optional)
    • 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
    • 1 cup (240ml) milk 
    • 2 large eggs
    • 1 1/2 cups (210g) all-purpose flour
    • 2 tablespoons non-fat milk powder
    • 1 teaspoon baking powder
    • 2 quarts (1.9L) peanut oil
    • 4 soft hamburger buns, toasted in butter
    • 8 dill pickle chips
Directions
    1. Dissolve 1/2 cup (120g) kosher salt (see note) and 1/4 cup (50g) sugar in 1 quart (950ml) of cold water. 
        Place chicken breasts in a zipper-lock bag and add brine. 
        Transfer to refrigerator and let sit for at least 6 hours and up to overnight. 
       
    2. Meanwhile, combine black pepper, paprika, MSG (if using), and cayenne in a small bowl. Set aside. 
       
    3. Whisk together milk and eggs in a medium bowl. Set aside.  
       
    4. Combine flour, non-fat milk powder, baking powder, remaining 1/2 teaspoon (3g) kosher salt, remaining 2 teaspoons (8g) sugar
        , and 2 tablespoons of spice mixture in a large bowl and whisk until homogenous. 
       Drizzle 3 tablespoons (45ml) milk-egg mixture into flour mixture and rub with fingertips until the flour mixture is coarse like wet sand. 
       You can add 1 ½ tsp bk powder 
       and ½ tsp bk. Soda. Instead of drizzle the milk egg mixture, try drizzle with water.
       
    • In a large wok, deep fryer, or Dutch oven, preheat oil to 350°F (177°C). 

    • Remove chicken breasts from brine and pat dry with paper towels. Season on all sides with remaining spice mixture. Transfer to milk mixture and turn to coat. Working one cutlet at a time, allow excess milk mixture to drip off then transfer to flour mixture. Turn to coat, pile extra mixture on top of cutlet, and press down firmly to adhere as much mixture as possible to the meat. Lift cutlet, shake off excess flour, then slowly lower into hot oil. Repeat with remaining breasts. 
    • Cook, turning breasts occasionally until golden brown and crisp on all sides, and chicken is cooked through, about 4 minutes total. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. 
    • Place 2 pickles on each bottom bun and a fried chicken cutlet on top. Close sandwiches, then cover with an overturned bowl or aluminum foil and allow to rest for 2 minutes to steam buns. Serve immediately.

BEFORE YOU BEGIN

*To thaw frozen puff pastry, let it sit either in the refrigerator for 24 hours or on the counter for 30 minutes to 1 hour. 

Instructions

1.Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment. 
Melt butter in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. 
Cook onion, thyme, garlic, and salt until softened, about 4 minutes. 
Stir in flour and cook for 1 minute. Whisk in half-and-half, bring to simmer, and cook until thickened, about 1 minute. 
Transfer to large bowl and stir in chicken and peas and carrots (mixture will be thick). Season with salt and pepper to taste.

2.If puff pastry sheets are larger than 9½ by 9 inches, trim to that size. 
Lightly brush 1 dough sheet with egg wash (reserve remaining egg wash). 
Divide filling into 4 equal portions and place on dough. 
Place second dough sheet on top, stretching and firmly pressing dough around edges and between filling portions to seal. 
Cut assembled dough into four squares and place on prepared sheet. Using fork, crimp edges of dough to seal. 
Cut three 1-inch slits on top of each pie.

3.Brush tops of pies with remaining egg wash. Bake until well browned, 20 to 24 minutes. Let cool slightly. Serve.

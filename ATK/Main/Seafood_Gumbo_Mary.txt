Put olive oil in metal pan and add flour (to make roux or you can buy it – note down below). Stir constantly until this roux mixture becomes chocolate brown. Do not burn.
Turn off fire and immediately add to the roux onion, bell pepper, celery, and garlic while stirring constantly for a minute or two, then add 1 quart of water to the roux mixture.
Transfer roux to a large porcelain pot (use large pot) and add two more quarts of water.
Add the herbs and salt. Bring to a boil and simmer until texture is right.
Than add okra and andouille sausage. Simmer down some about 1 hour or less. Now add the seafood, putting in the most delicate seafood types just before ending the process (Crab lumps and scallops for example).

Erythritol = 100 g / 1/2 cup (You can also use other keto friendly sweetener to taste)
Eggs = 4 large
Vanilla Extract = 1 tsp
DIRECTIONS
1. Preheat the oven at 350F or 180C.
2. In a bowl, beat the butter and erythritol at medium to high speed until light and fluffy. 
Scrape the sides intermittently.
3. Add the eggs one at a time and whisk to combine.
4. Add the vanilla extract and whisk to combine.
5. Add the coconut or almond flour, baking powder, salt and whisk at low speed to combine. 
The batter should be smooth and thick.
6. Scoop the batter into an 8x4" loaf pan lined with parchment paper. Spread evenly.
7. Bake for 40 mins for the coconut flour version and 55 mins for the almond flour version as the loaf is bigger. 
It is done when a wooden skewer comes out clean.
8. If the top is browning too fast, cover with foil.
9. Once the cake is done, rest it upside down for 15 minutes. This is to prevent the butter from settling at the bottom. 
After resting, turnover and slice the cake accordingly. 
10. The cake can be kept at room temperature for about 2 to 3 days if you have a cool and dry climate otherwise, it is better to refrigerate earlier. 
The cake can be eaten chilled and it actually tastes good. It can also be reheated for 30 seconds in the microwave.
11. The cake can be refrigerated for up to a week and frozen for months.

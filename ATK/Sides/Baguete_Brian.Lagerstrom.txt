225g or 1c warm water (90F/32C) ▪
350g or 3c bread flour ▪
10g or 1 3/4tsp salt ▪(9gr instead)
8g or 1 3/4tsp instant yeast ▪
30g or 3Tbsp warm water (86F/30C) 

Add flour and 225g/1c of the 90F/32C water to a bowl and stir to combine. 
When dough has combined into a shaggy ball, begin to squeeze and pinch the dough with a very wet hand. 
When the dough forms a less shaggy, more cohesive ball, add salt to top of dough. Cover dough. 
In a separate container add yeast and 30g or 1/4c of the 86F/30C water and stir to combine. 
Allow both the dough and yeast mixture to sit for 15-20min. 
Add yeast mixture into the salted dough. Mix with a soaking wet hand by pinching and turning (about 3 to 8 minutes).
Once yeast and salt are fully incorporated, cover and allow to rise at room temperature for 30 minutes. 
Perform a strength building fold as shown @2:29. Cover and allow to sit at room temp for 30 more minutes. 
Perform a second strength building fold - see @2:59. Cover and allow to ferment at room temp for another 90 minutes. 
Place a piece of well oiled parchment on an upside down sheet tray. 
Flour work surface and dough and flip dough onto work surface. 
Divide dough into two equal pieces (300g each). Degas and preshape dough balls as shown @3:50. 
Cover and allow to relax for 15-20min. Shape dough balls into baguettes as shown @4:22. 
Place shaped baguettes onto oiled parchment, cover and allow to proof at room temp for 60-90 minutes. 
I’m using the foil pan linked here: https://amzn.to/3JLY3l4 . After proofing, the baguettes should have risen by about 50-60%. 
Spray well with water, then score the top of the baguettes, cover again with foil pan, and bake in a preheated 450F/230C oven for 30-35min, carefully removing the cover after 15 minutes of bake time.

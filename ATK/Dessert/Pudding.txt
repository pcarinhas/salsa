DIY Vanilla Instant Pudding Mix
Makes about 5 batches of pudding; 4-5 servings per batch

Ingredients
3/4 cup nonfat dry milk powder
3/4 cup cornstarch
1 cup granulated white sugar
2 whole vanilla beans (I always buy them from this site.)
1 teaspoon Kosher salt

In a large mixing bowl, combine the dry milk, cornstarch, white sugar, and
salt. Use a knife to slice down the center of the vanilla beans lengthwise and
scrape out the seeds. Add the seeds to the dry ingredients and whisk well until
evenly distributed (you may need to use the back of a spoon or spatula to break
up the little clumps of seeds). Cut the scraped-out vanilla beans in 2-3 pieces
each, and drop into an air-tight jar or container (such as a mason jar). Pour
the mixture in, seal, and shake a couple times to distribute the vanilla bean
pieces. Store in a cool dry place.

To make the pudding, combine 1/2 cup of the mix with 2 cups of milk in a medium
saucepan over high heat, whisking constantly. Bring to a boil (keep an eye on
it because this happens quickly!), then reduce heat to a simmer and continue
whisking until the mixture thickens and coats the whisk or spoon. (About 3-5
minutes).  Pour in a container and let set for at least 5 minutes before
serving. Can be served warm or cold.DIY Vanilla Instant Pudding Mix Makes about

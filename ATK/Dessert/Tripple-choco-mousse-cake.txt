Triple-Chocolate Mousse Cake
/from the Episode: Triple-Chocolate Mousse Cake
<episode.asp?episodeid=275&iseason=10>/

This recipe requires a springform pan at least 3 inches high. It is
imperative that each layer is made in sequential order. Cool the base
completely before topping it with the middle layer. We recommend
Ghirardelli Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Bar for the base and middle
layers; our other recommended brand of chocolate, Callebaut Intense Dark
L-60-40NV, may be used, but it will produce drier, slightly less sweet
results. Our preferred brand of white chocolate is Guittard Choc-Au-Lait
White Chips. For best results, chill the mixer bowl before whipping the
heavy cream. The entire cake can be made through step 8 and refrigerated
up to a day in advance; leave it out at room temperature for up to 45
minutes before releasing it from the cake pan and serving. For neater
slices, use a cheese wire or dip your knife in hot water before cutting
each slice.

1. *FOR THE BOTTOM LAYER:* Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat
oven to 325 degrees. Butter bottom and sides of 91/2-inch springform
pan. Melt butter, chocolate, and espresso powder in large heatproof bowl
set over saucepan filled with 1 inch of barely simmering water, stirring
occasionally until smooth. Remove from heat and cool mixture slightly,
about 5 minutes. Whisk in vanilla and egg yolks; set aside.

2. In stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, beat egg whites and salt
at medium speed until frothy, about 30 seconds. Add half of brown sugar
and beat until combined, about 15 seconds. Add remaining brown sugar and
beat at high speed until soft peaks form when whisk is lifted, about 1
minute longer, scraping down sides halfway through. Using whisk, fold
one-third of beaten egg whites into chocolate mixture to lighten. Using
rubber spatula, fold in remaining egg whites until no white streaks
remain. Carefully transfer batter to prepared springform pan, gently
smoothing top with offset spatula.

3. Bake until cake has risen, is firm around edges, and center has just
set but is still soft (center of cake will spring back after pressing
gently with finger), 13 to 18 minutes. Transfer cake to wire rack to
cool completely, about 1 hour. (Cake will collapse as it cools.) Do not
remove cake from pan.

4. *FOR THE MIDDLE LAYER:* Combine cocoa powder and hot water in small
bowl; set aside. Melt chocolate in large heatproof bowl set over
saucepan filled with 1 inch of barely simmering water, stirring
occasionally until smooth. Remove from heat and cool slightly, 2 to 5
minutes.

5. In clean bowl of stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, whip
cream, granulated sugar, and salt at medium speed until mixture begins
to thicken, about 30 seconds. Increase speed to high and whip until soft
peaks form when whisk is lifted, 15 to 60 seconds.

6. Whisk cocoa powder mixture into melted chocolate until smooth. Using
whisk, fold one-third of whipped cream into chocolate mixture to
lighten. Using rubber spatula, fold in remaining whipped cream until no
white streaks remain. Spoon mousse into springform pan over cooled cake
and gently tap pan on counter 3 times to remove any large air bubbles;
gently smooth top with offset spatula. Wipe inside edge of pan with damp
cloth to remove any drips. Refrigerate cake at least 15 minutes while
preparing top layer.

7. *FOR THE TOP LAYER:* In small bowl, sprinkle gelatin over water; let
stand at least 5 minutes. Place white chocolate in medium bowl. Bring  
cup cream to simmer in small saucepan over medium-high heat. Remove from
heat; add gelatin mixture and stir until fully dissolved. Pour cream
mixture over white chocolate and whisk until chocolate is melted and
mixture is smooth, about 30 seconds. Cool to room temperature, stirring
occasionally, 5 to 8 minutes (mixture will thicken slightly).

8. In clean bowl of stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, whip
remaining cup cream at medium speed until it begins to thicken, about 30
seconds. Increase speed to high and whip until soft peaks form when
whisk is lifted, 15 to 60 seconds. Using whisk, fold one-third of
whipped cream into white chocolate mixture to lighten. Using rubber
spatula, fold remaining whipped cream into white chocolate mixture until
no white streaks remain. Spoon white chocolate mousse into pan over
middle layer. Smooth top with offset spatula. Return cake to
refrigerator and chill until set, at least 2  hours.

9. *TO SERVE:* If using, garnish top of cake with chocolate curls or
dust with cocoa. Run thin knife between cake and side of springform pan;
remove side of pan. Run cleaned knife along outside of cake to smooth
sides. Cut into slices and serve.




Step-by-Step: Slicing Soft Cake

*1.* Hold the handles and pull the wire taut. Using your thumbs to apply
even pressure, slice down through the cake. Wipe the wire clean with a
dry towel. 	
*2.* Make a second cut, perpendicular to the first. Continue to make
cuts around the circumference.

Step-by-Step: Triple-Decker Construction

*BOTTOM LAYER*
A modified flourless chocolate cake made with whipped egg whites, egg
yolks, butter, dark chocolate, and sugar provides a sturdy but not
dense base. The cake collapses as it cools. 	
*MIDDLE LAYER*
The layer's silky yet sliceable consistency is similar to regular mousse
in texture, with flavor from dark chocolate and cocoa powder.

*TOP LAYER*
Made with whipped cream and white chocolate, this layer is the lightest
in flavor and texture. The addition of a little gelatin helps to make
the topping sliceable.

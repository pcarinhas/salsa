Marzipan (Almond Paste)
1 Cup (86gr) almond flour
¾ cup (85gr) confectioners’ sugar
A pinch of salt (1/16 tsp)
¾ tsp almond extract (more or less to taste)
½ of a large egg white (15 gr)

Combine almond flour and sugar in a food processor or blender, processing briefly
just to combine. 
Add salt, almond extract and egg white; if you whisk the egg white until foamy, it’s easier to divide.
Process until the mixture comes together and forms a malleable ball.

Peanut Butter Cookies

Ingredients

2 1/2 c. all-purpose flour
1 tsp. baking soda
1/2 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. kosher salt
1 c. (2 sticks) butter, softened
1 c. granulated sugar
1 c. packed brown sugar
2 large eggs
1 1/2 c. creamy peanut butter

Directions
1. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. 
2. Using a stand or hand mixer, beat butter and sugars on medium speed until very fluffy, 2 minutes. Beat in eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add peanut butter and continue mixing until mixture is completely smooth and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes more.
3. Add flour mixture in batches and continue mixing, scraping sides of bowl as you go. Refrigerate batter 1 hour.
4. When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350° and line two baking sheets with parchment. Drop tablespoons of dough on prepared baking sheets, about 2” apart. 
5. Using a fork, score cookies with a cross-hatch pattern. 
6. Bake until golden, 15 to 18 minutes. Transfer to wire rack to let cool before serving.

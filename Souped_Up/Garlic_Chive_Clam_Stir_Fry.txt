INGREDIENTS
- 200 g of clam meat
- 350 g of Chinese chives shots
- 3 cloves of garlic
- 1.5 tsp of ginger
- 3-5 piece of Thai bird eye chilies (can be switched to jalapeno)
- 1.5 tbsp of fish sauce
- 1.5 tbsp of oyster sauce

INSTRUCTIONS
- Ok. Let's cut the chive shoots into 2 inches long sticks. Set it aside. 
You can also use asparagus or green beans instead of chive shoots.
- Defrost the clam meat by rinsing the with room temperature water a couple times. Drain the water. 
Set the clam meat aside. You can also use shrimp, squid to replace the clam meat.
- Heat your wok to smoking hot. Add some oil and toss it around. 
Throw in all the aromatics: 3-4 cloves of garlic, 1.5 tsp minced ginger, some diced Thai birds eye chili.
- Give them a quick stir and toss in the clam meat. 
Keep cooking them for a minute or 2. Push them to side and make room for the garlic chive shoots. 
Tilt the wok to let heat focus on the chives instead of the clam meat. 
It will just take a couple of minutes and the chives shoots will be wilted. 
Then mix everything together. Quickly add in some fish sauce and some oyster sauce. 
Mix and you are done. Enjoy!

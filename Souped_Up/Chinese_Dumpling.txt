INSTRUCTION

- For making dumplings, you want to used dumpling flour.
If you can not find dumpling flour, you can use bread flour. Just check the protein content before picking a brand (10% is good). 
If you can’t even find bread flour, I have a trick. You can use all-purpose flour and add 2 eggs and water to the flour to make it higher in protein. 
I like to measure it together because each egg is different. Here is my suggestion - for every 400 grams of all-purpose flour you will need 205 - 210 grams of the egg/water mixture. Now you know the secret behind the perfect dumpling wrapper. We can get started.

- Measure out 400 grams of dumpling flour and add 1/2 tsp of salt. Give it a mix then slowly pour in 200 to 210 grams of room temperature water. 
Use chopsticks to stir it while you are adding the water. Gathering all the flour together and make it into a dough. 
Knead the dough for about 5-6 minutes or until smooth. Cover it and let it sit for 20 minutes.

- 20 minutes later, knead it again for another 5 minutes. Cover it with a slightly damp towel and let it sit for 1hour. 
The reason we knead it twice is to help develop the protein. That will make sure your dumpling wrapper has great texture.

- While waiting, you can make the filling. Today I am making my pork celery filling. It is very easy.
- You will need 350 grams of ground pork, 200 grams of celery, 1/2 cup of diced scallion, 1.5 tbsp soy sauce, 1.5 tsp of oyster sauce, 1 tbsp of vegetable oil, 1/2 tsp of salt, 1 egg, some garlic ginger puree.

- Stir it within one direction for 6-8minutes and beat the filling. 
Set the filling in the fridge and we will take a look of the dough.

- It should be more soft and playable. Now it is the time to divide the dough into many small and even pieces. 
Put your dough on the cutting board and sprinkle some flour to prevent stickiness. Roll the dough into a thick piece. 
Then cut it into thick strips. Make sure you measure it so the strips turn out with the same thickness. 
Once you finished that, line them up together. Cut it into small pieces. Use something to measure it as well. 
It doesn’t matter the length and the width as long as all the dough pieces are the same size. 
I normally don’t use a scale, but if you ask, I will say each dough should be about 11-12 grams.

- Cover it with a slightly damp towel and we can start making the dumpling wrappers. 
Take one piece and flatten it by your hand. Roll it into a round wrapper with a thick middle and thin edge. 
The size can be big or small, depends on how big dumplings do you want to make.

- Take some filling. Put it on the wrapper. Fold the wrapper in half and pinch it a little bit. 
Push both sides toward to the middle and sew the edge. Reinforce it just to make sure they won’t open when cooking. 
This recipe is enough to make about 50 -60 dumplings.

- You want to use a heavy duty pan. Add some oil. Toss it around so the oil covers the bottom. 
We gonna use medium heat to do this. The oil will start heating up while you are adding the dumplings. 
Wait for a minute or 2 then add 1/4 cup of water. Cover it. Let it cook until all the water is gone. 
If your lid can be completely sealed, do leave a small gap to let the steam come out. 
Once all the liquid is evaporated, check the bottom to see the color. If it is nice and golden brown. 
You can plate them up and serve with your favorite dipping sauce.

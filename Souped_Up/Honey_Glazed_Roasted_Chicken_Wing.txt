1.5 tsp of salt
2 tbsp of honey 
1 inch of ginger, crushed and diced

INSTRUCTION 

We will make the marinade first. In a bowl, add the following ingredients: 2 tbsp of soy sauce, 1 tbsp of hoisin sauce, 1 tbsp of oyster sauce, 1 tbsp of sriracha, 2 tbsp of honey, 1.5 tsp of salt, crushed ginger, scallions, and garlic. Mix and set it aside. 

For the chicken wings, you just use paper towels to absorb the moisture; you do not want any excess liquid to dilute the seasoning. 

Add all the wings into a zip-lock bag along with the marinade. Push out as much air as possible and seal the bag. Give them at least a 5 minutes massage to even out the marinade. That is all the preparation. So easy. Let it sit in the fridge overnight. 

The next day, preheat the oven to 420 degrees F. Take the wings out and place them onto a baking rack. Let it bake for 25 minutes. 

25 minutes later, take the chicken wings out. They are already looking good, but if you check underneath the color is not as good so I like to flip them all over and bake them for another 15-20 minutes. Every oven is different so please keep an eye on it. 

Glaze the chicken with 3 tbsp of honey.

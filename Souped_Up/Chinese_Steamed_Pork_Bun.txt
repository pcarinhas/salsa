INSTRUCTION

- 梅菜干(Mei Cai Gan), it is a category of sundry leafy vegetables in Hakka cuisine. If you can’t find this ingredient, you can use dry shitake mushroom, wood ear fungus, or fresh vegetables. Soak the dehydrated bok choy in some warm water for at 3 hours in advance.
- 3 hours later, take it out and squeeze the water. The end of the stem is a little tough and fibery. Cut it off and discard it. Slice the bok choy finely and set it aside.
- Finely diced some ginger, few cloves of garlic and a piece of scallion. Slice a small shallot thinly.
- Heat your wok and add some cooking oil. Throw in all the aromatics. When the shallot becomes a bit translucent, push it to the side so you have room to cook the ground pork. When the meat changes color, you can mix the aromatics. Stir for a minute or 2, then push everything to the side again. You should see a lot of meat juice appearing on the bottom. Add the dehydrated bok choy. We want to cook the bok choy until it absorbs the meat juice. Mix everything then we can add the seasonings: 1 tbsp of soy sauce, 1 tbsp of oyster sauce, 1.5 tbsp of Chinese cooking wine, 1/2 tsp of salt, 1 tsp of sugar, 1 tsp of dark soy sauce. Mix the seasoning. Then give it a taste to adjust the flavor. It should be saltier than what you normally like because we gonna wrap it into the unsalted buns. Take it out. Your filling is done.
- Let’s move on to the buns. You will need 500 grams of all-purpose flour. Add 1.5 tsp of baking powder to the flour. Whisk to cooperated them well.
- Add 1 tbsp of sugar and 2 tsp of dry yeast into 280 grams of water. Mix until the sugar is dissolved. Pour this yeast water into the flour in batches. Mix with a pair of chopstick at the same time. Gather all the flour together. Make it into a dough. Keep kneading it on a working surface. In about 5-6 minutes of kneading, the dough should be smooth, elastic. We gonna cover that and let it sit for 5-8 minutes. This is not proofing. This is to let gluten to relax a little so the dough will be much more playable.
- Poke a hole in the center of the dough and use that to stretch the dough into a big ring. Cut one side open and you have a long log. The amount I gave is enough to make 12 big buns, so we gonna cut this into 12 even pieces and shape each piece into a smooth ball.
- Flatten the ball with the palm of your hand. Then use a rolling pin to roll it bigger. Lift the sheet and roll the edge to make it thinner. Eventually, you will have a wrapper with a thinker middle and a thinner edge.
- Put the filling in the middle of the wrapper. This is how I close the buns. Your thumb and middle finger go under the wrapper, and the forefinger goes above it. Lift it to make the first pleat. Keep folding it to continue making the pleats. Do it all the way around. When you reach the end, just twist and pinch to close the buns.
- Brush a thin layer of oil in the steamer. Put the buns in. Leave some space between each bun because they will be bigger after steaming.
- You just put the buns above some warm water. Let it sit for 15-20 minutes.
- 20 minutes later, you can turn the heat to high and bring the water to a boil. Once you can see the steam coming up, start counting the time. 
Let it steam for another 15 minutes. Then you can turn off the heat but do not open it immediately. 
Let it sit for at least 3 minutes or else the skin will shrink once the cold air hit the buns and you will lose the fluffiness.

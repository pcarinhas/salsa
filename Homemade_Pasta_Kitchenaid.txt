Makes 4 portions (6 as first course)

Pasta Dough:

300 g flour (bread flour) 
2 tsp Diamond Crystal Kosher salt (or 1 tsp table salt) (5.7g if weighing on a high precision scale) 
185g wet ingredients* (I am getting a lot of comments saying that it sounds like I am saying "285". it's "get to hundred eighty five", not "get two hundred eighty five".)

* Wet ingredients:

2 large eggs 
3 large yolks 
weigh the eggs and yolks then add enough water to get to 185 grams total 

Buzz flour and salt in the food processor for 10 sec. Add the wet ingredients and process until dough forms. Knead by hand for 12 minutes. Flour the dough, wrap in plastic, and let rest 30 min to 5 hours at room temp. Divided into 4 parts. 
Spread flour on the table so the dough won’t stuck when you roll it in the pasta roller.
Divided into 4 parts. 
Using the kitchen aid attachment, the lowest setting first 
Take one and wrap the others back into the plastic to avoid dryness.
Flattened the dough and roll it into the pasta roller.
Fold the dough like a letter, folding it into thirds, flattened it out and it through the pasta roller again.
Do this about 4 times with the same setting (the first setting), until you get close to a rectangle.
Add more flour to avoid sticky.
After you get the shape of a rectangle, you can start use the next settings.
Roll it twice for each setting.
After the 4th or 5th setting, you might want to cut the dough in half to avoid it’s getting too long.

Inert Sugar:
600 gr sugar
300 gr water
45 gr lemon juice, strained
60 gr water 
1 gr (¼ tsp) baking soda

Put water, lemon juice, sugar, heat in medium heat. Stir it gently with rubber spatula, make sure there is no sugar crystalized on the spatula. 
If it does, clean the spatula. 
Bring it to a boil. After the sugar dissolved, lower the heat to low. 
You don’t need to stir after it boils and the sugar has dissolved.
If there is crystalized sugar on the side of the pot, you can brush it with a brush dip in water.
Let it simmer until golden brown and it reached temperature of 127 – 128 Celcius (260 – 262 Fahrenheit).
It took me about an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes. Turn off the heat
Combine 60 gr water and ¼ tsp bk. Soda. Add to the liquid and stir. It will make bubbles.
It is going to look liquidy (thin) but it will thicken up after a day or two.
Put it in the measuring cup, the bubbles will subside, the following day.

If you want a light color then you just need to reach temperature of 112 - 114 celcius or 234 - 237 Fahrenheit

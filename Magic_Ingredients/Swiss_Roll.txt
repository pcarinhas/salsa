Swiss Roll

Cake:
5 eggs (separate yolk and whites)
70 gr oil
60 gr milk
90 gr cake flour
1 tsp vinegar
¼ c sugar

Preheat oven 320 F.
We use 11 ½ x 13” cookie pan, cover with parchment paper. If you don’t have it, you can put aluminium foil as a divider.

Whisk yolks with milk and oil, add sift flour. Mix till thick, when you pick up the batter, it will stream like a ribbon.
In another bowl beat the egg whites with vinegar till medium peak (don’t over beat).
Add the egg white to the yolks flour mixture in 3 addition. Fold gently till combined.

Pour batter to the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 30 minutes.
After it’s done, take it out from the sheet and put it in a wire rack for 10-15 minutes, till warm.
Put it on the table and put a bigger parchment paper on the top and flip it. Take the original parchment paper out and flip it back.
Roll the cake ¾ way, put it in the refrigerator while you are making the whip cream. The cake will hold the shape.

Whip Cream
¾ c heavy cream
3 Tbsp sugar

Put a bowl in the fridge so it is cold.
Put the heavy cream and sugar the beat till thick.

Take the cake out and spread the whip cream, roll it back.

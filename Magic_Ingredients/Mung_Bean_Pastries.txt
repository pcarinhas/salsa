preheat oven 375 °F/190 °C bake for 5 minutes first，then reduce the temperature to 325 °F/165 °C bake for 15 minutes (first time I baked for 30 minutes)

Mung bean filling:
1. Soak mung bean overnight
2. Next day, drain the bean, steam for 35 minutes. Put in the food processor and blend it.
3. Slice shallot thinly.
4. Heat 60 gr of oil, when the oil not too hot fry the shallot till golden brown in low heat, put it aside
5. In the same pan add mung bean to the aromatic oil about 3-5 minutes.
6. Add the sugar, salt, pepper, stir it well. Turn off the heat and add the shallot. Put it in a bowl.
7. Use Tablespoon measurement to make a ball (we just need 16 balls)

Doug:
1. Dissolve 30 gr sugar with 95 gr water.
2. In a separate bowl, put 200 gr flour, oil and sugar water.
3. Mix with rubber spatula till combine, briefly knead it and let it rest for 20 minutes.
4. After resting,knead the dough to completely smooth, about 3-5 minutes.
5. Cover it and let it rest for 1 hour.
6. After 1 hour divide it to 16 pieces

Oil and flour mixture:
1. In the mean time, in a bowl, mix 110 gr of flour and oil with spatula till combine then with hand to completely combined. Cover it.
2. After the dough is ready, cut it to 16 pieces.

To assemble:
Take one piece of the dough, flattened it in your palm and add the oil and flour mixture ball.
Wrap the flour, oil mixture in the dough. Make a ball.
Flattened then roll it with rolling pin. Make two folds. When you do folds, keep the glossy surface below. This will become the smooth surface on top of the mung bean pastry.
Flattened it again and roll it. Make a fold again. Make sure you oil the table so the dough won’t stick to the table.
Take one piece of the folded dough, make kind a round ball by pinching the edges together. Flattened it and roll. 
Put the mung bean filling in the middle and turn it over, try not to touch the surface with hands. Seal the bottom.
Rest for 15 minutes.

Put parchment paper in the baking sheet and bake for 5 minutes in 375 F and turn down the heat to 325 F bake for another 15 – 25 minutes.

Thin crust pizza ingredients：
Pizza dough （for 4 servings）

all purpose flour：500g (I used King Arthur Unbleached Flour)
salt：1/2 teaspoon - no taste (I used 3/4 tsp salt --good result)
olive oil：2 tablespoons 
yeast：1/2 teaspoon (Active Dry Yeast)
room temperature water：350g (too sticky – I used 310 gr --good result -5/10/2023, next time use 315 gr)

Dissolve yeast in water first, then mix all the ingredients. Form a dough, and rest it for 20 minutes. 
Then knead the dough till smooth. Coat with olive oil and ferment at the room temperature for 24 hours (her temperature is 69 F). 
I put it for 6-8 hours till it's 4-5 times the size since the temperature in our house is 79 F then put it in the refrigerator..
The next day. De-gas, separate into 4 pieces (try 3 pieces next time) and round the dough. Continue to ferment for 2 hours in room temperature.

You can par bake the dough at 350 F for 5 minutes and cool it down before put them in freezer.
We baked for 5 minutes at 525 F and rotate bake for another 2 minutes.
You can heat the pizza stone by broil it first for 30 - 40 minutes (check it with the temperature gun, the temperature of the stone should be at least 500 F)

Preheat oven 550 F, bake for 5-6 minutes then turn on the broiler for 1 minute (this is original recipes instruction for baking it)

ingredients：for making 8 croissants (I am not using spoon for measurement, I use grams)
dry active yeast 2g 1/2 teaspoon 
room temperature water 155g 1/2 cup+2 tablespoons 
unbleached all purpose flour or bread flour 330g 2 cups + 1/4cup (I used King Arthur Unbleached)
sugar 30g 2 tablespoons 
salt 4 g 1/2 teaspoon 
room temperature unsalted butter 20g 1 tablespoon 
unsalted butter 180g 3/4 cup (used 9 Tbsp on 5/8/2023, 5/29, next time use 8 Tbsp) 

425° F/218° C bake for 10 minutes first, then 375° F/190° C bake for 12-14 minutes

For cinnamon roll, I bake for 35 minutes 350 F (convection oven)

1. Add active yeast to water, mix it well
2. Combine flour, sugar, salt and 20 gr softened butter
3. Add the water to the flour mixture, use chopstick to mix then knead till it together.
4. Cover with a plate for 20 minutes
5. After 20 minutes, knead till it smooth and let it rest for 1 – 2 hours (double in size)
6. Put it in the refrigerator for 3-4 hours or overnight
7. While the dough rested in the refrigerator, cut the rest of the butter ¼” thick and put it in the parchment paper (wrap it).
8. Roll the butter in between the parchment paper into a square (flattened it). 
9. Take the dough out, flattened it so it’s big enough to put the butter in the middle and wrap it.
10. Roll the dough to a rectangle, long enough to fold the right side edge to the middle and fold the left side to make an envelope
11. Put it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. 
12. Take it out after 30 minutes, roll it (with the opening facing you)to a rectangle wide enough to fold the right side to the middle and the left side to the middle as well
this will make 4 layers. Then fold it to make an envelope (fold the middle).
13. Put it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
14. Take it out. Put it on the table with the opening facing you. Roll it to a rectangle (big enough) 1/4" thick and put the cinnamon sugar mix on top.
15. Roll it from the side close to you. Cut it into 8 pieces. Bake. (For cinnamon roll I let it rest for 30 minutes).

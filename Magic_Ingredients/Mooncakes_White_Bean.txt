Mooncake Filling
200 gr white kidney beans (white navy beans)
80 gr oil
80 gr sugar

1. Soak the beans overnite
2. Cook them in the pressure cooker, after the indicator (in the middle) jiggles. Turn the heat to medium low. Cook for 20 minutes.
3. Blend them in the Food Processor, blend them till smooth.
4. Put them in the non stick pan, cook them over low heat. Add the oil (divided into 2 additions).
5. When it’s combined, add the sugar (divided into 3 additions).
6. Cook them until they are not sticky to the side. This takes a long time, maybe 30 minutes
7. Put them in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap.
8. You can make this a day before you will make the cookies.
9. The next day, weigh a ball 25 gr each. Roll into a ball.

Preheat oven to 375 F

Mooncake Dough
125 gr unsalted butter
50 gr icing sugar
1 egg yolk
1/2 tsp vanilla
1 Tbsp honey
20 gr milk powder
220 gr cake flour (I added 1 - 1/2 Tbsp more flour)

1. Cut the butter into thick pieces. Put them in microware for about 20-25 seconds. You should still see chunk of butter, make sure not all the butter melted.
2. Add sugar and mix in low speed first then on high speed until butter look pale. Scrap the sides and keep mixing.
3. Add egg yolk, vanilla, honey, mix till combined.
4. Add the milk powder and flour through a sifter, mix on low speed till combined. Dough should not stick to your hands.
5. Cover and let them rest for 15 minutes.
6. Make balls that weigh 25 gr each.
7. Take one ball at a time and make a hole by pressing the middle of the ball.
8. Put the bean filling in the middle and close it.
9. Put it in the molding (dust a little of corn starch on the molding to avoid sticking)
10. On a cookie sheet layer with parchment paper, press the molding and release.
11. Prepare 1 egg yolk with 1 tsp water for brushing the top and sides of the cookie.
12. You can put another cookie sheet on the bottom so the cookie won’t burn easily.
13. Cook cookie for 18 - 23 minutes, when it hit 8 minutes you can brush it again with the egg yolk mix.
14. Store the cookies in a sealed container, put paper towel on top of the cookies. You don’t need to wait till the cookies completely cool. 
A little hot it’s ok.
15. The color will be golden the next day.

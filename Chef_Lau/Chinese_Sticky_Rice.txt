Chinese Sticky Rice

Ingredients
3 Cups uncooked short grain glutinous rice, soaked in water for 3-4 hours
1 cup dried Shiitake mushrooms, soaked in water for 1 hour, drained and chopped
5 links of Chinese Sausage, diced
1 TB vegetable oil
1 TB finely minced, peeled fresh ginger
1/3 cup Chinese cooking rice wine
4 TB regular soy sauce
3 TB oyster sauce
4 tsp sesame oil
½ tsp white pepper
2 1/3 cups chicken broth
½ cup thinly sliced scallions (greens only)

Instructions
1. Drain rice and rinse with cold water. Set aside
2. Heat a heavy large pot with 1 TB oil until hot. Add ginger and stir fry for a minute. Add Chinese sausage and Shiitake mushrooms, stir frying for another minute. Stir in rice wine, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, white pepper, and rice. Stir to coat thoroughly. Add broth, stir to incorporate, and bring to a boil.
3. Once it reaches a boil, immediately reduce to simmer. Cover tightly and cook 45 minutes. Turn heat off and let it sit for at least 10 minutes, covered. Do not peak!
4. Carefully stir cooked sticky rice, from bottom to top throughout. Cover and let stand another 10 minutes before serving.
5. Garnish with freshly sliced scallions, if desired.
6. Note: if you’re watching salt intake, you may use reduced-sodium chicken broth.

You can add ham.

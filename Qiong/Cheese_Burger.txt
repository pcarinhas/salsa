3. Add the milk mixture to flour, with chopstick or rubber spatula mix.
4. Knead with hand till combine. Knead more on the counter top, put the butter in the middle and keep kneading till it smooth. 
Put it in the same bowl and let it rest for 1 hour (double the size)
5. After it doubled in size, poke a hole in the middle (dip your finger in flour, a little sticky it's ok). The hole should hold the shape.
